The hint says that the problem can be solved on any channel,
so therefore, it probably has something to do with the freenode commands.

Since the word help is highlighted and it's asking for someone's name,
it's likely something to do with the help command.

Looking at the possible commands help gives, we see a command called
credits. Doing '/help credits' display the list of people who helped
document the IRC commands in help.

One of the people has a username called zartik. His name is
Daniel Hemmerich, which is the flag.
