The problem asks us to find a suspicious process, so let's use volatility to list all the processes in the dump.

$ volatility -f memdump.mem pslist

Looking at the processes, we can see a process with an id of 1768 called wtf_who_names_k, which
looks like a flag.

Let's dump the contents of the executable running the process:
$ volatility -f memdump.mem memdump -p 1768 --dump-dir .

Running `strings 1768.exe | head` will give us the flag.
