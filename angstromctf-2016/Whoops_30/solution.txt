We are given a disk image, with the mention of deleted files.
Using testdisk, we can recover the contents of the image, and look around.

The hint mentions something about where deleted files go, so let's look inside the .Trashes
folder.

In oops/.Trashes/Files/books, we find flatland.txt with the flag at the end:

flag{waw_.Trashes_isnt_useless_after_all}
