Plug the ciphertext into the almighty quiqiup to decrypt the substitution cipher:

'through me you pass into the city of woe:
through me you pass into eternal pain:
through me among the people lost for aye.
justice the founder of my fabric moved:
to rear me was the task of power divine,
supremest wisdom, and primeval love.
before me things create were none, save things
eternal, and eternal i shall endure.
all hope abandon, ye who enter here.'
