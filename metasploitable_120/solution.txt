Opening up the pcap file in wireshark, we find a bunch of tcp streams.

Following tcp stream 2 (filter = tcp.stream eq 2), we find a suspicious base64 encoded string.
Decoding it, we get some sort of php conditional, which compares the file contents to some sha1 hashed string.

I've managed to extract the php code executed when the check passes, which can be found in extracted.php.

$ php extracted.php
